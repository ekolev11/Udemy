<h1>The Best Movies According to Eugene</h1>

<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Fast and Furious 1-2</h3>
<p>I am a fan of sports cars and in this movie i saw some cool ones.<br/>
There were also very exciting street races in this movie, too bad that later on the movies were ruined and turned into a action - shooting movies.</p>
<h3>Lord of the Rings</h3>
<p>I loved every part of this absolute classic.<br/>
It was really awesome watching this in the early 2000's as a kid, it included magic, knights, huge armies clashing in great battles, it remains in my top 3 forever.</p>
<h3>Drunken Master</h3>
<p>Great classic action-comedy movie starring Jackie Chan, one of my favourite action heroes.<br/>
Really funny comedy movie which also included some bare knuckle fights and cascades.</p>
