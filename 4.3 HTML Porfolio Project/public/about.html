  <h1>About Me:</h1>
<p>I am Eugene, born in 1999 in Bulgaria, Gabrovo.</p>

<p>For the most part i have worked as a driver on various positions like courier, street photographer and food delivery,<br/>
Driving was and still is something i really enjoy, i also enjoy communicating with different people and going to different places/</p>

<p>I like to get the job done and by that i mean that i really enjoy solving problems and completing tasks,
  in the recent years i have found a new passion - coding, it is very enjoyable for me.
  Since i cannot afford university education, i chose to be a self-taught programmer, i bought some courses online and every day i am making steps to become better.
  Someday i hope i can reach a level which allows me to work for an IT company, i really dream and work hard to get to this day.
